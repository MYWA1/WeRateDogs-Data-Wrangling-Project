# WeRateDogs-Data-Wrangling-Project
The tweets of WeRateDogs, also known as Twitter user @dog rates, are included in this dataset. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates users' dogs and adds a lighthearted comment. The denominator of these scores is almost always 10. 

However, the numerators? frequently more than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? because "Brent, they're good dogs." Over 4 million people follow WeRateDogs, and it has been featured in international media.

Also included in this project are the reports on the acts which i followed for data wrangling steps and insights visualized from my wrangled data.
